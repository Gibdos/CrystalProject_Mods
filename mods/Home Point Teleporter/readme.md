# ✴️ The Glyphic Relocator Crystal Project Mod ✴️

## Home Point Teleport Free Version
##### ❗️ NOT RECOMMENDED FOR FIRST TIME PLAYERS ❗️
An item that let's you **freely teleport to any home point** in the game. 
You get it automatically when you start a new game or you can get it from the Nan that gave you your first map.

This one has all home point teleport locations automatically enabled without the need for the glyphs.
You can still stumble upon the glyph items in the game, but they are not needed.


## Home Point Teleport
An item that let's you **freely teleport to any home point in the game**. 
You get it automatically when you start a new game or you can get it from the Nan that gave you your first map.

This one requires you to find 30+ glyph items hidden around the world. Each glyph enables their corresponding home point(s).

As an example: The **Capital Sequoia Glyph** unlocks the following home points in the Glyphic Relocator

* Bulletin Square
* Training Grounds
* West Market District
* Know-It-All Ducks' House
* East Market District
* Castle Sequoia Foyer

I hope you enjoy this little mod. I put a lot of work and effort into it.

## Glyph Locations
I highly encourage you to try and find the glyphs by yourself. It's part of the adventure.
But if you really can't find <u>*that one glyph*</u>, feel free to check in the [Glyph Location Reference](https://github.com/Gibdos/CrystalProject_Mods/blob/8119b7f881bc2a6fbc2a7f6c4a6b60c218fe9851/mods/Home%20Point%20Teleporter/Glyph_Location_Reference.pdf).

## Compatibility & Testing
* The mod has been tested with version 1.6.1
* All glyphs have been tested and are obtainable when starting a new game
* All glyphs have been tested and ***should*** be obtainable if the mod is used otherwise
    * If I missed any strange situations and a glyph is unobtainable, feel free to open an issue
