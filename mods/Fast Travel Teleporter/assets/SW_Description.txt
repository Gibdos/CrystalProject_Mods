You get it automatically when you start a new game or you can get it from the Nan that gave you your first map.

This version requires you to find 30+ glyph items hidden throughout the world. Each glyph enables their corresponding home point(s).

As an example: The [b]Capital Sequoia Glyph[/b] unlocks the following home points in the Glyphic Relocator

[list]
    [*]Bulletin Square
    [*]Training Grounds
    [*]West Market District
    [*]Know-It-All Ducks' House
    [*]East Market District
    [*]Castle Sequoia Foyer
[/list]

I hope you enjoy this little mod. I put a lot of work and effort into it.

[h2]Glyph Locations[/h2]

I highly encourage you to try and find the glyphs by yourself. It's part of the adventure.
But if you really can't find <u>[i]that one glyph[/i]</u>, feel free to check in the [url=https://github.com/Gibdos/CrystalProject_Mods/blob/main/mods/Fast%20Travel%20Teleporter/Glyph_Location_Reference.pdf]Glyph Location Reference[/url].
